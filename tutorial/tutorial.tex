\section{Introduction}

Serverless Computing (also known as Function as a Service) is emerging as a new and compelling paradigm for the deployment of cloud applications, largely due to the recent shift of enterprise application architectures to containers and microservices.

From the perspective of an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) customer, this paradigm shift presents both an opportunity and a risk. On the one hand, it provides developers with a simplified programming model for creating cloud applications that abstracts away most, if not all, operational concerns; it lowers the cost of deploying cloud code by charging for execution time rather than resource allocation; and it is a platform for rapidly deploying small pieces of cloud-native code that responds to events, for instance, to coordinate microservice compositions that would otherwise run on the client or on dedicated middleware. On the other hand, deploying such applications in a serverless platform is challenging and requires relinquishing to the platform design decisions that concern, among other things, quality-of-service (QoS) monitoring, scaling, and fault-tolerance schemes.

From the perspective of a cloud provider, serverless computing provides an additional opportunity to control the entire development stack, reduce operational costs by efficient optimization and management of cloud resources, and enabling a serverless ecosystem that encourages the deployment of additional cloud services.

Serverless platforms promise new capabilities that make writing scalable microservices easier and cost effective, positioning themselves as the next step in the evolution of cloud computing architectures. Most of the prominent cloud computing providers including Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, and Google have recently released serverless computing capabilities. There are also several open-source efforts including the OpenLambda project.

Serverless computing has been utilized to support a wide range of applications. From a functionality perspective, serverless and more traditional architectures may be used interchangeably. The determination of when to use serverless will likely be influenced by other non-functional requirements such as the amount of control over operations required,cost, as well as application workload characteristics.

From a cost perspective, the benefits of a serverless architecture are most apparent for \emph{bursty, compute intensive} workloads. Bursty workloads fare well because the developer offloads the elasticity of the function to the platform, and just as important, the function can
scale to zero, so there is no cost to the consumer when the system is idle. Compute intensive workloads are appropriate since in most platforms today, the price of a function invocation is proportional to the running time of the function. Hence, I/O bound functions are
paying for compute resources that they are not fully taking advantage of. In this case, a multi-tenant server application that multiplexes requests may be cheaper to operate.

From a programming model perspective, the stateless nature of serverless functions lends themselves to application structure similar to those found in functional reactive programming.

One class of applications that are very much suitable for is event-based programming. The most basic example, popularized by AWS Lambda, that has become the ``Hello World" of serverless computing is a simple image processing event handler function. The function is connected to a data store, such as Amazon S3, that emits change events. Each time a new image file is
uploaded to a folder in S3 an event is generated, and forwarded to the event handler function that generates a thumbnail image that is stored in another S3 folder. The flow is depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig:UseCase-Thumbnail}. This example works well for serverless demos as the function is completely stateless and idempotent which has the advantage that in the case of failure (such as network problems accessing the S3 folder), the function can be executed again with no side effects. It is also an exemplary use case of a bursty, compute intensive workload as described above.

In this tutorial, we will present serverless computing, survey existing serverless platforms from industry, academia, and open source projects, identify key characteristics and use cases, and  describe technical challenges and open problems. Our tutorial will involve a hands-on experience of using the serverless technologies available from different cloud providers (e.g. IBM, Amazon, Google and Microsoft). We expect our users to have basic knowledge of programming and basic knowledge of cloud computing.


Serverless computing is still in its infancy, hence it should be of interest to the ICDCS community, because there an opportunity for researchers to understand it and shape it by addressing the challenges that it faces. We hope that this tutorial (along with the first ICDCS workshop on serverless computing WoSC 2017) provides the first steps in understanding the technology and architecture of Serverless computing. \footnote{More information about this tutorial can be found at http://www.serverlesscomputing.org/tutorial/}
