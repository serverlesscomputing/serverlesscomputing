  <h2 id='intro'>Welcome to WOSCx: Unveiling Future Serverless technologies </h2>

  <p>
    Over the last nine years, Serverless Computing (Serverless) has gained an enthusiastic following in industry as a compelling paradigm for the deployment of cloud applications, and is enabled by the recent shift of enterprise application architectures to containers and microservices. Many of the major cloud vendors have released serverless platforms, including Amazon Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Microsoft Azure Functions, IBM Cloud Functions. Open source projects are gaining popularity in providing serverless computing as a service.
  </p>

  <p>
    Serverless on the cloud is a somewhat mature research area with many conferences accepting papers on this topic. In the spirit of having this workshop serve as a venue for future and exploratory research directions, we will be evolving the workshop to include hybrid cloud environments, as well as edge and IoT devices. These next-gen computing architectures are becoming more common but have little support from serverless platforms and bring new challenges to old concerns such as resource optimization, scaling, cost, monitoring, and ease of use. The serverless experience becomes an important topic for emerging topics such as DevOps and Platform Engineering in industry and will be critical to the success of next-gen computing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Building on the recent advances in generative AI, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and other types of Foundations Models (FMs), we are looking for submission that explore the use of hybrid serverless platforms to fine-tune, serve, and manage the lifecycle of LLMs with a focus on aspects such as use cases, resource allocations, optimizations, and using AI to improve serverless experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the spirit of having this workshop serve as a venue for future and exploratory research directions, we want to evolve the workshop to include hybrid cloud environments, as well as edge and IoT devices. These next-gen computing architectures are becoming more common but have little support from serverless platforms and bring new challenges to old concerns such as resource optimization, scaling, cost, monitoring, and ease of use.
  </p>

  <p>
    We encourage you to consider sharing your perspective on the future of serverless computing. The workshop format is online and consists of short live video presentations and online discussion. See below <a href="#dates">important dates</a> about sending your talk proposal. If your talk proposal is accepted we ask you to do a video recording as a backup in case of network issues. The video should be not longer than 10 min (please let us know if you want a shorter lightning talk or need a longer time for your talk). Optionally send slides and we will link them from the workshop website.
  </p>
