  <h2 id='intro'>Welcome to WOSCx: Unveiling Future Serverless technologies </h2>

  <p>
    Over the last nine years, Serverless Computing (Serverless) has gained an enthusiastic following in industry as a compelling paradigm for the deployment of cloud applications, and is enabled by the recent shift of enterprise application architectures to containers and microservices. Many of the major cloud vendors have released serverless platforms, including Amazon Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Microsoft Azure Functions, IBM Cloud Functions. Open source projects are gaining popularity in providing serverless computing as a service.
  </p>

  <p>
    Serverless on the cloud is a somewhat mature research area with many conferences accepting papers on this topic. In the spirit of having this workshop serve as a venue for future and exploratory research directions, we will be evolving the workshop to include hybrid cloud environments, as well as edge and IoT devices. These next-gen computing architectures are becoming more common but have little support from serverless platforms and bring new challenges to old concerns such as resource optimization, scaling, cost, monitoring, and ease of use. The serverless experience becomes an important topic for emerging topics such as DevOps and Platform Engineering in industry and will be critical to the success of next-gen computing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Building on the recent advances in generative AI, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and other types of Foundations Models (FMs), we are looking for submission that explore the use of hybrid serverless platforms to fine-tune, serve, and manage the lifecycle of LLMs with a focus on aspects such as use cases, resource allocations, optimizations, and using AI to improve serverless experience.

    <h2 id="talks">Talks</h2>
    
<h3 id="t1">Scalable and Secure Serverless Runtimes</h3>
<p>Presenter: Rodrigo Bruno<p>
<p>Abstract: The future of cloud computing is currently at an impasse. On the one hand, cloud computing is evolving in the direction of resource disaggregation, high elasticity, high density, and hands-off infrastructure management. Serverless is a clear example of this trend. On the other hand, existing virtualization stacks (Virtual Machines, Containers, and Language Runtimes) are slow to start and impose a high memory footprint tax. The combination of high elasticity and density with bloated virtualization stacks is fundamentally at odds, exposing a great tension between the serverless vision and existing virtualization infrastructure. In other words, existing virtualization technology was fundamental to building cloud computing as we know it today, but is also now becoming its limiting factor. In this talk, I propose revisiting sandboxing technology to enable extreme virtualization stack density by allowing concurrent functions to co-execute in a single stack.<p>
<p>Bio: Rodrigo Bruno is an Assistant Professor at Instituto Superior Técnico (University of Lisbon) and a Senior Researcher INESC-ID Lisbon. Before joining Técnico, Rodrigo was a Senior Researcher at Oracle Labs Zurich working on GraalVM. Rodrigo joined Oracle Labs after spending two years as a Post-doc researcher at ETH Zurich, which he started after receiving his Ph.D. from Técnico. Most of his research lies down on the intersection between Systems and Programming Languages, with a particular focus on language runtimes, cloud computing, virtualization, operating systems, and compilers.<p>


<h3 id="t2">Serverless computing: A security perspective</h3>
<p>Presenter: Eduard Marin<p>
<p>Abstract: Serverless computing is gaining popularity as a new computing paradigm for the deployment of applications in the cloud​. With the increase and diversity of attacks against clouds, security and privacy will be key factors for its widespread adoption. However, as serverless computing has only recently emerged, neither its attack surface nor its security mechanisms have been properly analyzed by the scientific community. The main objective of this talk is to shed light on the security and privacy threats within the serverless ecosystem to understand the actual level of security serverless platforms provide.<p>
<p>Bio: Eduard Marin is a Research Scientist at Telefonica Research (Spain). He holds a Master's degree in Telecommunication Engineering from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (2013) and a Ph.D. in Engineering from the KU Leuven (2018). Before joining Telefonica, he was a visiting research fellow at the University of Padova (Italy) and a postdoctoral researcher iat the University of Birmingham (UK). // Eduard's research falls in the intersection of security, networks and systems. Currently his work focuses on analysing and improving the security of networking and computing paradigms recently proposed, such as Software Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualisation (NFV), programmable data planes, containers or serverless computing, among others.<p>


<h3 id="t3">Envisioning the Future Multi-Cloud Serverless: Introducing a System for Efficient Serverless Function Offloading</h3>
<p>Presenter: Mohammad Shahrad<p>
<p>Abstract: Serverless computing has gained significant traction in the past few years. Removing most of the provisioning burden from the shoulders of developers, offering a pay-per-use pricing model, and accelerating deployment of scalable applications are some of serverless's unique attractions. In addition to all of these, the serverless model can play a catalyst role in building multi-cloud solutions; both as a lightweight glue to connect various clouds, and to build native multi-cloud serverless applications. It appears that building multi-cloud systems is a lot more realistic with serverless applications than with traditional cloud workloads. In this talk, I will present our vision on serverless's potential in building multi-cloud solutions. Additionally, I will showcase my team's latest work on UnFaaSener, a framework that facilitates the seamless offloading of functions from serverless platforms. While our primary objective is to assist serverless developers in reducing their bills, UnFaaSener also establishes the groundwork for broader serverless offloading capabilities, which are essential for multi-cloud serverless systems.<p>
<p>Bio: Mohammad Shahrad is an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of British Columbia (UBC). He is broadly interested in improving the efficiency of cloud systems and has worked across the stack toward this goal. This includes building novel scheduling solutions for cloud systems, modeling user-provider interactions to propose new pricing models, and building a new processor for efficient off-chip scalability of cloud workloads. Mohammad's research has been deployed in production, won the USENIX Community Award, and been featured in the CACM Research Highlights. Before joining UBC, Mohammad was a Computer Science Lecturer at Princeton University. He holds a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Princeton University and spent a year at Microsoft Research working on cloud efficiency projects.<p>


<h3 id="t4">Can WebAssembly create an ideal serverless experience?</h3>
<p>Presenter: Aleksander Slominski<p>
<p>Abstract: WebAssembly (Wasm) is a portable binary code similar to JVM bytecode, but it has different features that make it ideal for serverless applications. Wasm is designed to be simple and start small, which aligns well with the goals of serverless computing, especially Function-as-a-Service (FaaS). Each Wasm module can be compiled or pre-compiled to binary code, which solves the problem of cold starts. Additionally, Wasm modules can be dynamically linked with other modules, which promises a great serverless experience where developers can make small code changes and instantly see the results. Wasm also has a very strong security model with sandboxing and limited access to resources until explicitly granted. I will talk about my experience with running Wasm with Knative Functions and show a quick demo of how to go from source code to a serverless container in Kubernetes with a single command.<p>
<p>Bio: Aleksander Slominski is a Research Staff Member in the Serverless Group in Cloud Platform, Cognitive Systems And Services department at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center. He works on open source serverless computing Knative project and presented about building Knative eventing applications during KnativeCon in Kubecon NA 2022. He organizes International Workshops on Serverless Computing (WoSC) to bring together researchers and industry practitioners to discuss their experiences and thoughts on future directions.<p>

<h3 id="t5">WebAssembly as an Isolation Mechanism for the Cloud</h3>
<p>Presenter: Carlos Segarra<p>
<p>Abstract: WebAssembly (WASM) is a platform-independent binary instruction format that can be used as an isolation mechanism in the cloud. WASM is memory-safe by design, allowing WASM-isolated programs to run safely in the same address space. WASM's execution state is self-contained in a contiguous mutable arary of bytes, and interactions with the host environment are mediated by a standarised system interface (WASI). This makes WASM-isolated programs easy to checkpoint for low startup times, migration, or fault-tolerance.

In this talk we present our experiences using WASM as an isolation mechanism for serverless with Faasm and Faaslets, and for MPI and OpenMP with Faabric and Granules. We also outline some of the challenges WASM needs to overcome to gain widespread adoption, namely accelerator support (e.g. GPUs or FPGAs), and hardware-based isolation for hyperscale-grade multi-tenancy.<p>
<p>Bio: Carlos is a third-year PhD student at the Large-Scale Data & Systems group of the Imperial College London. His research interests include the design and implementation of secure and efficient cloud runtimes. Particularly, he is interested in lightweight isolation mechanisms and confidential computing. All of his work is open source and available on GitHub.<p>


<h3 id="t6">A Serverless Infrastructure for the Metaverse</h3>
<p>Presenter: Jesse Donkervliet<p>
<p>Abstract: The metaverse is an important emerging research topic with large societal interest and industry investment, led by Meta and Apple. A metaverse leverages state-of-the-art virtual-reality (VR) devices to provide new levels of immersive experiences to users. However, providing these experiences and supporting this technology efficiently and responsibly is an open research problem. VR devices are more latency sensitive than common existing interactive devices such as smartphones, require more computational resources to track user movement, and are constrained by limited battery capacity. To address these challenges, we envision a serverless infrastructure for metaverse applications that provide applications with low latency and good power and cost efficiency by using dynamic differentiated deployment, novel consistency models, and serverless operation.<p>
<p>Bio: Jesse Donkervliet is a PhD student and teacher at the VU Amsterdam. His research focus on large-scale online gaming and the metaverse.<p>

<h3 id="t7">Adaptive serverless edge computing</h3>
<p>Presenter: Tomasz Szydlo<p>
<p>Abstract: Serverless edge computing combines the advantages of well-known serverless computing paradigm with the geographic distribution of the computational infrastructure. Distributed locations of heterogeneous edge servers constitute multi-cloud continuum enabling the workload distribution across different cloud environments to leverage the unique capabilities and offerings.  It also reduces delays in real-time data processing, the amount of data sent to computational clouds, contextual operation and efficient on-demand resource utilization.

Despite the overall benefits, serverless edge computing is particularly vulnerable to the dynamics of the operating environment due to the usage of renewable energy sources, lack of adequate cooling, limited servicing and low-power wireless communication technologies. Therefore, the research challenge is to make these solutions adaptive to ever-changing working conditions and provide the desired quality of service. A promising solution involves the usage of ML and TinyML for providing adaptive intelligence to the computational infrastructure. In the talk, we will discuss the aforementioned problems and possible solutions.<p>
<p>Bio: Tomasz Szydlo is currently appointed as Associate Professor at the AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow, Poland and as Senior Lecturer in the School of Computing, Newcastle University, UK.

scientific computing. By adopting cloud-native technologies, scientific
researchers can accelerate their computational capabilities, optimize
resource utilization, and enable collaborative research across
institutions and geographical boundaries. Scientific workflows serve as
a framework managing complex computational workloads in scientific
research. Kubernetes, an open-source container orchestration platform,
provides a robust infrastructure for managing and scaling scientific
workflows in cloud environments.

<h3 id="t9">Examples of scientific applications of serverless computing</h3>
<p>Presenter: Maciej Malawski<p>
<p>Abstract: Serverless computing has been designed to support dynamic event-driven applications, but there are many examples of interesting use cases where serverless computing can be used in the scientific computing domain. This talk will present some recent examples of solutions we developed to support scientific applications from biomedicine and physics with the use of serverless computing model.

The CloudVVUQ library supports development of digital twins in computational medicine, in which an important step is to run verification, validation and uncertainty quantification campaigns, requiring many-task computing. HPC-Whisk is an extension of OpenWhisk which allows spawning serverless clusters via SLURM allowing efficient use of idle resources, which in turn can be used e.g. by Monte Carlo simulations in physics. Root Lambda is an extension of ROOT framework for data analysis in high energy physics, which enables to run distributed analysis using AWS Lambda. All these tools demonstrate that serverless computing can be an interesting alternative to traditional computing models used by scientists.

<h3 id="t10">How Can We Train DL Models Across Clouds and Continents? An Experimental Study</h3>
<p>Presenter: Alexander Isenko<p>
<p>Abstract: Training deep learning models in the cloud or on dedicated hardware is expensive.
A more cost-efficient option are hyperscale clouds offering spot instances, a cheap but ephemeral alternative to on-demand resources.As spot instance availability can change depending on the time of day, continent, and cloud provider, it could be more cost-efficient to distribute resources over the world. Still, it has not been investigated whether geo-distributed, data-parallel spot deep learning training could be a more cost-efficient alternative to centralized training.

This paper aims to answer the question: Can deep learning models be cost-efficiently trained on a global market of spot VMs spanning different data centers and cloud providers?
To provide guidance, we extensively evaluate the cost and throughput implications of training in different zones, continents, and clouds for representative CV and NLP models.
To expand the current training options further, we compare the scalability potential for hybrid-cloud scenarios by adding cloud resources to on-premise hardware to improve training throughput. Finally, we show how leveraging spot instance pricing enables a new cost-efficient way to train models with multiple cheap VMs, trumping both more centralized and powerful hardware and even on-demand cloud offerings at competitive prices.<p>

<h3 id="t15">Streams Under Test</h3>
<p>Presenter: Jawad Tahir<p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed stream processing systems (DSPSs) are widely used to process large volumes of data and provide real-time insights. However, due to their distributed nature, failures are inevitable and can cause performance degradation and data loss. In order to overcome these challenges, DSPSs employ various failure-recovery mechanisms to ensure fault tolerance. Additionally, they offer processing guarantees (PGs) to ensure the accuracy of the processed results under failures. In this paper, we introduce an open-source benchmarking tool that measures the impact of various failures on the performance of a DSPS. The tool is capable of measuring key performance metrics such as latency, throughput, recovery time, and correctness of a DSPS under different failure scenarios. Our benchmarking experiments were conducted on three popular DSPSs, namely Kafka Streams, Apache Storm, and Apache Flink. Our results show that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for failures in DSPSs, and each system has its own unique strengths and weaknesses. For instance, our experiments revealed that a failure may reduce the throughput by half in Apache Storm, while in Apache Flink, it can cause a complete halt of data processing, resulting in a throughput drop to zero. On the other hand, Kafka Streams demonstrated negligible decrease in throughput under the same failure. Moreover, we evaluated the accuracy of each DSPS under various failure scenarios against their respective PGs. Surprisingly, our findings indicate that PGs do not ensure correct results in every failure scenario. Interestingly, some DSPSs even produced incorrect results in the absence of any failure. Overall, our benchmarking tool and experimental results provide valuable insights into the performance and fault tolerance capabilities of popular DSPSs. This information can help researchers and practitioners in selecting the most suitable DSPS for their specific use case.<p>

<h3 id="t16">FLEdge: Benchmarking Federated Machine Learning Applications in Edge Computing Systems</h3>
<p>Presenter: Herbert Woisetschläger<p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Machine Learning (FL) has received considerable attention in recent years. FL benchmarks are predominantly explored in either simulated systems or data center environments, neglecting the setups of real-world systems, which are often closely linked to edge computing. We close this research gap by introducing FLEdge, a benchmark targeting FL workloads in edge computing systems. We systematically study hardware heterogeneity, energy efficiency during training, and the effect of various differential privacy levels on training in FL systems. To make this benchmark applicable to real-world scenarios, we evaluate the impact of client dropouts on state-of-the-art FL strategies with failure rates as high as 50%. FLEdge provides new insights, such as that training state-of-the-art FL workloads on older GPU-accelerated embedded devices is up to 3x more energy efficient than on modern server-grade GPUs.<p>

<h3 id="t17">Caching large temporary data in serverless workloads with a co-located ephemeral store</h3>
<p>Presenter: Aitor Arjona<p>
<p>Abstract: The serverless computing paradigm has undergone significant evolution and is now widely recognized as a practical solution for flexible workloads in the cloud. However, the challenge of managing temporary data in serverless workloads remains unresolved. The stateless nature of serverless functions requires reliance on remote storage, which introduces latency and increases data movement, leading to performance degradation for complex workflows. Existing approaches have limitations in accommodating large datasets, while others involve utilizing fast remote storage, which incurs additional infrastructure costs and management complexities. Furthermore, none of these solutions effectively handle both persistent and ephemeral data. To address these challenges, we propose a collaborative tiered ephemeral storage system for FaaS. We leverage the ephemeral file system allocated for each serverless function, allowing functions to store and share temporary data across concurrent and successive invocations. Our approach unifies temporary and persistent data by interfacing with cloud object storage, enabling optimized input data ingestion through caching and in-place modification of output data. To validate our approach, we will employ a genomics variant calling pipeline, which can benefit from caching input data as well as handling complex temporary data movements. Overall, the proposed storage system aims to enhance FaaS systems by exploiting locality for temporary data in order to improve performance in data-intensive workloads.<p>

<h3 id="t18">λFS: Scaling Distributed File System Metadata Services using Serverless Functions</h3>
<p>Presenter: Ben Carver<p>
<p>Abstract: The metadata service (MDS) sits on the critical path for distributed file system (DFS) operations, and therefore it is key to the overall performance of a large-scale DFS. Common “serverful” MDS architectures, such as a single server or cluster of servers, have a significant shortcoming: either they are not scalable, or they make it difficult to achieve an optimal balance of performance, resource utilization, and cost. A modern MDS requires a novel architecture that addresses this shortcoming. 

To this end, we design and implement λFS, an elastic, high-performance metadata service for large-scale DFSes. λFS scales a DFS metadata cache elastically on a FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) platform and synthesizes a series of techniques to overcome the obstacles that are encountered when building large, stateful, performance-sensitive applications on FaaS platforms. λFS takes full advantage of the unique benefits offered by FaaS—elastic scaling and massive parallelism—to realize a highly-optimized metadata service capable of sustaining up to 4.13× higher throughput, 90.40% lower latency, 85.99% lower cost, 3.33× better performanceper-cost, and better resource utilization and efficiency than a state-of-the-art DFS for an industrial workload.<p>

<h3 id="t19">Enabling Publish/Subscribe Services on GEDS</h3>
<p>Presenter: Pezhman Nasirifard<p>
<p>Abstract: GEDS is a data management system for efficiently storing and transferring ephemeral data developed by IBM Research Europe. It provides seamless integration with various frameworks, such as Apache Spark, enabling efficient data processing. GEDS offers the flexibility to store data on the local memory, ensuring fast access, or on cloud providers like AWS S3. However, the current design relies on a central metadata service (MDS) to handle metadata operations, which becomes a bottleneck for scalability. To address these issues and improve the scalability and performance of GEDS, we propose enhancing the MDS with Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) features. This modification enables efficient metadata propagation to nodes that read data and enhance overall scalability. Our evaluation, conducted using the TPC-DS benchmark, demonstrates that a Pub/Sub-enabled MDS significantly improves the performance of GEDS.<p>

<h3 id="t20">Blackbox operators for dynamic data management frameworks</h3>
<p>Presenter: Josef Spillner<p>
<p>Abstract: Apache Calcite is a dynamic data management framework with SQL parser and validator (including variants), query optimisation and schema source adapters. However, not all queries, workflows and pipelines can be mapped to Calcite, and in some cases there may be initial support but the specific remain unclear. In this secondment project, a couple of research questions in this space should be answered: Is it possbible to introduce a concept of blackbox operators to Calcite, and turn the black into grey by leveraging rich metadata to still consider them during the query optimisation phase? How can UDFs, windowing functions and other non-relational constructs be represented by such blackbox operators? And is there a path towards extending Calcite with a community-accepted implementation of those concepts so that more database management systems, big data frameworks, stream processors and other middleware could leverage the framework? The WOSCx talk will present a case of serverless UDFs to demonstrate the desired outcome of the project.<p>

<h3 id="t21">Artificial Intelligence for Smart Environments</h3>
<p>Presenter: Aurora González-Vidal<p>
<p>Abstract: My research can be divided into two related areas: basic research for developing algorithms that solve data-related problems and data-based knowledge extraction algorithms from sensorised environments with applications in Internet of Things verticals.
Time series segmentation and representation: consists of the division or compression of time series into smaller, more manageable segments loosing as little information as possible. We have worked on methods based on Discrete Cosine Transformation and eigenvalue decomposition for representation of both univariate and multivariate data.
Federated Learning is a distributed machine learning approach that allows training models on decentralized data sources without the need to transfer the data to a central server. We have studied supervised (non-iid classes) and are working on unsupervised (GMM with Autoencoders) scenarios as well as identifying the challenges of dynamic client selection and aggregation function selection and creation.
Transfer Learning consists of leveraging the learned representations or knowledge from a pre-trained model instead of training a model from scratch. Our approach consists of clustering the elements of study, selecting a centroid and using such a centroid as the representative from which to train the main model and transfer it to the rest. 
Missing Values imputation. Considering the spatiotemporal nature of IoT data and the uncertainty of the data collected by sensors, we have studied bayesian methods as a convenient way to estimate missing values in multivariate time series.
The verticals in which these algorithms and other data analytics methodologies have been applied in my research include smart buildings, marine sciences and agriculture, transportation, and security.

<h3 id="t22">Kubernetes Error Localization</h3>
<p>Presenter: Sacheendra Talluri<p>
<p>Abstract: Kubernetes is the most popular container orchestration software, used by 70% of enterprises. Kubernetes has 256 features with 1000s of configurations, making it difficult to debug configuration errors. We propose an error localization tool that identifies the configuration lines that are most likely to have caused an error. We make use of dynamic dataflow tracking, publicly available Kubernetes configurations, and coverage guided fuzzing for error localization.<p>
