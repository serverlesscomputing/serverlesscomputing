10th International Workshop on Serverless Computing (WoSC10) 2024

   Part of [1]ACM/IFIP Middleware 2024.

   WoSC10 will be hybrid this year with both virtual and on-location
   formats. Please note that while hybrid formats will be supported for
   workshops, the Middleware 2024 steering committee wants the main
   conference to be held in in-person only. Prospective attendees of the
   workshop should keep this in mind if they plan to attend both WoSC10
   and Middleware 2024.

   Over the last ten years, Serverless Computing (Serverless) has gained
   an enthusiastic following in industry as a compelling paradigm for the
   deployment of cloud applications, and is enabled by the recent shift of
   enterprise application architectures to containers and microservices.
   Many of the major cloud vendors have released serverless platforms,
   including Amazon Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Microsoft Azure
   Functions, IBM Cloud Functions. Open source projects are gaining
   popularity in providing serverless computing as a service.

   Recently, Kubernetes gained in popularity in enterprise and in
   academia. Several open source projects such as OpenFaaS and Knative aim
   to provide developers with serverless experience on top of Kubernetes
   by hiding low-level details. Auto-scalable Multi-tenant Kubernetes
   deployments like Google Cloud Run or IBM Code Engine also overcome
   previous limitations of Serverless Functions like duration, networking,
   and higher granularity (more vCPUs).

   Serverless on the cloud is a somewhat mature research area with many
   conferences accepting papers on this topic. In the spirit of having
   this workshop serve as a venue for future and exploratory research
   directions, we will be evolving the workshop to include hybrid cloud
   environments, as well as edge and IoT devices. These next-gen computing
   architectures are becoming more common but have little support from
   serverless platforms and bring new challenges to old concerns such as
   resource optimization, scaling, cost, monitoring, and ease of use. The
   serverless experience becomes an important topic for emerging topics
   such as DevOps and [2]Platform Engineering in industry and will be
   critical to the success of next-gen computing.

   Building on the recent advances in generative AI, including Large
   Language Models (LLMs) and other types of Foundations Models (FMs), the
   workshop also plans to explore the use of hybrid serverless platforms
   to fine-tune, serve, and manage the lifecycle of LLMs with a focus on
   aspects such as use cases, resource allocations, optimizations, and
   using AI to improve serverless experience.

   This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners to discuss
   their experiences and thoughts on future directions of serverless
   research.

   As this year the workshop is hybrid and we are looking not only for
   research papers, experience papers, demonstrations, or position papers
   but also for live presentations of ongoing work, demonstrations, and
   anything else that may be interesting to workshop audience.

Papers and Submissions

Papers submissions

   Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished
   research/application papers that are not being considered in another
   forum.

   Submitted manuscripts should be structured as technical papers and may
   not exceed six (6) single-spaced double-column pages using ACM SIGPLAN
   style, which can be found on the ACM template page. The page limit
   contains all the content, including bibliography, appendix, etc.

   Note that submissions must be doubly anonymous - authors’ names must
   not appear on the manuscript, and authors must make a good-faith
   attempt to anonymize their submissions.

   Submitted papers must adhere to the formatting instructions of the ACM
   SIGPLAN style, which can be found on the [4]ACM template page. The font
   size has to be set to 10pt.

   The Middleware conference organizers will provide companion proceedings
   including all workshop papers, which will be available in the ACM
   Digital Library. This is subject to the availability of their
   camera-ready papers by October 27, 2024.

   Authors should submit the manuscript in PDF format. All manuscripts
   will be reviewed and will be judged on correctness, originality,
   technical strength, rigour in analysis, quality of results, quality of
   presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference attendees.
   Papers conforming to the above guidelines can be submitted through the
   paper submission system powered by HotCRP
   ([5]https://wosc2024.hotcrp.com/).

   All submitted manuscripts (following MIDDLEWARE conference requirements
   on formatting and page limits) will be peer-reviewed by at least 3
   program committee members. Accepted papers with confirmed presentation
   will appear in the conference proceedings as well as in the ACM Digital
   Library.

   Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you
   can complete the publishing process> for your accepted paper. ACM has
   been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a
   commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors
   ([6]https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs). The
   collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement
   throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability,
   ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts
   around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

Anonymity Requirements for Doubly-Anonymous Reviewing

   Every research paper submitted to ACM Middleware 2024 will undergo a
   ''doubly-anonymous'' reviewing process: in addition to maintaining the
   anonymity of the reviewers of the papers, the PC members and reviewers
   will not know the identity of the authors. To ensure the anonymity of
   authorship, authors must at least do the following:
    1. Authors' names and affiliations must not appear on the title page
       or elsewhere in the paper.
    2. Funding sources must not be acknowledged anywhere in the paper
       under review; these can be added to accepted papers upon submission
       of the camera-ready manuscript.
    3. Non-anonymized links to the authors’ online content must be
       removed.
    4. Research group members, or other colleagues or collaborators, must
       not be acknowledged anywhere in the paper.
    5. The paper’s file name must not identify the authors of the paper.

   Authors should also use care in referring to related past work. The
   solution is to reference past work in the third person (in the same way
   that one would reference work by anyone else). This allows you to set
   the context for your submission while at the same time preserving
   anonymity.

   Despite the anonymity requirements, authors should still include all
   relevant work, including their own; omitting them could reveal the
   author's identity by negation. However, self-references should be
   limited to the essential ones, and extended versions of the submitted
   paper (e.g., technical reports or URLs for downloadable versions) must
   not be referenced. The goal is to preserve anonymity while allowing the
   reader to grasp the context of the submitted paper fully. It is the
   responsibility of authors to do their very best to preserve anonymity.
   Papers that do not follow the guidelines or potentially reveal the
   author's identity are subject to immediate rejection.

Other submissions

   Authors are invited to submit proposals for demos and other
   presentations that are not papers.

   Proposals must be submitted as short abstracts (not longer than one
   page) in PDF format using the paper submission system HotCRP
   ([7]https://wosc2024.hotcrp.com/).

   Accepted presentations will not be part of the conference proceedings
   but will be part of the workshop agenda with dedicated time for live
   presentation (with video backup), questions etc.
