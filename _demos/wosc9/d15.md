I will summarize my talk that I gave at the TEWI Kollokvium and add our latest research.	I'll focus on composition and interoperability of BaaS services, also based on my recent paper presented on WORKS [https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3624062.3624282](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3624062.3624282)
