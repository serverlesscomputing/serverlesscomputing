In this demo, we will practically present how to simulate data-aware serverless workflows with our recent SimLess simulator [https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3542929.3563478](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3542929.3563478). SimLess offers dynamic selection of location of any function of the workflow, including their memory. With its the mathematical model, SimLess accurately simulates even dynamic selection of location of ephemeral data, with minimum cost for configuration setup.
