Edge computing is a dynamically developing area of ​​systems research, which drives great interest in lightweight Kubernetes containers running on nodes with limited computing resources. In this talk, we will consider the possibilities offered by the clusters with heterogeneous computing modules and the benefits of physically deactivating computing nodes. The short presentation presents work-in-progress results of the research in this area.
