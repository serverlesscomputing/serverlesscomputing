I am going to describe my main lines of work and research. Those involve the application of machine and deep learning algorithms in the areas of marine sciences, smart agriculture and energy efficiency and also dimensionality reduction applied to time series for a classification problem. Finally, the current tasks proposed for GPUs monitoring are listed.
