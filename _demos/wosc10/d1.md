PlugFlow: Create and execute dynamic serverless workflows "Serverless computing has matured, leading to complex and dynamic applications that challenge workflow management systems, often lacking developer-friendly tools and simple configuration, making it hard to build workflows efficiently.

This demo will showcase PlugFlow, a platform to create and execute dynamic serverless workflows. PlugFlow lets developers integrate (""plug"") workflow logic directly into their applications. Functions can conditionally call other functions or return control to their caller, enabling flexible composition. Constructs like mapping, and parallel sections are also just functions, allowing runtime adjustments for greater flexibility.

Our solution targets developers, cloud architects, and researchers interested in enhancing serverless orchestration." we will join online, but we will a provide a backup video before the event we will provide the presentation before the event
