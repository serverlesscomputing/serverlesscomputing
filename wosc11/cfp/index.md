**Part of [ACM/IFIP Middleware 2025](https://middleware-conf.github.io/2025/) in Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA (December 15-19).**

> WoSC11 will be hybrid this year with both virtual and on-location formats. Please note that while hybrid formats will be supported for workshops, the Middleware 2025 steering committee wants the main conference to be held in in-person only. Prospective attendees of the workshop should keep this in mind if they plan to attend both WoSC11 and Middleware 2025.

## Welcome

Welcome
Over the last ten years, Serverless Computing (Serverless) has gained an enthusiastic following in industry as a compelling paradigm for the deployment of cloud applications, and is enabled by the recent shift of enterprise application architectures to containers and microservices. Many of the major cloud vendors have released serverless platforms, including Amazon Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Microsoft Azure Functions, IBM Cloud Functions. Open source projects are gaining popularity in providing serverless computing as a service.

Recently, Kubernetes gained in popularity in enterprise and in academia. Several open source projects such as OpenFaaS and Knative aim to provide developers with serverless experience on top of Kubernetes by hiding low-level details. Auto-scalable Multi-tenant Kubernetes deployments like Google Cloud Run or IBM Code Engine also overcome previous limitations of Serverless Functions like duration, networking, and higher granularity (more vCPUs).

Serverless on the cloud is a somewhat mature research area with many conferences accepting papers on this topic. In the spirit of having this workshop serve as a venue for future and exploratory research directions, we will be evolving the workshop to include hybrid cloud environments, as well as edge and IoT devices. These next-gen computing architectures are becoming more common but have little support from serverless platforms and bring new challenges to old concerns such as resource optimization, scaling, cost, monitoring, and ease of use. The serverless experience becomes an important topic for emerging topics such as DevOps and Platform Engineering in industry and will be critical to the success of next-gen computing.

Building on the recent advances in generative AI, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and other types of Foundations Models (FMs), the workshop also plans to explore the use of hybrid serverless platforms to fine-tune, serve, and manage the lifecycle of LLMs with a focus on aspects such as use cases, resource allocations, optimizations, and using AI to improve serverless experience.

This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners to discuss their experiences and thoughts on future directions of serverless research.
