Serverless computing offers scalability, simplicity, and cost-efficiency, but its environmental impact is increasingly concerning. Unlike conventional cloud computing, serverless introduces unique sustainability challenges. This paper presents a taxonomy of sustainability issues and solutions from provider- and user-side perspectives, covering technological strategies, policy proposals, and social considerations. We highlight current practices, identify research gaps, and outline directions to promote greener serverless infrastructures and applications.
