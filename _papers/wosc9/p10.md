This paper presents GreenCourier, a novel scheduling framework that enables the runtime scheduling of serverless functions across geographically distributed regions based on their carbon efficiencies. Our framework incorporates an intelligent scheduling strategy for Kubernetes and supports Knative as the serverless platform. To obtain real-time carbon information for different geographical regions, our framework supports multiple marginal carbon emissions sources such as WattTime and the Carbon-aware SDK. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of our framework using the Google Kubernetes Engine and production serverless function traces for scheduling functions across Spain, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Results from our experiments show that compared to other approaches, GreenCourier reduces carbon emissions per function invocation by an average of 13.25%.
