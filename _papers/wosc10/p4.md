Modern factories are moving towards modular layouts with more generic production cells, allowing rapid production customization. Here, the cell’s edge nodes exhibit considerable heterogeneity, ranging from simple microcontrollers to fully-fledged computing systems, which mandates that assembly-specific serverless functions used by Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) navigating through and linking the production cells are platform-independent. These moving manufacturing processes call for an adapted communication and distribution infrastructure to maintain low response times while minimizing network traffic. We present NimbleNet, a lightweight distribution and orchestration approach for serverless functions specifically tailored for IoT devices in industrial factory settings. NimbleNet leverages lightweight sandboxing such as WebAssembly, dynamic dependency management, and a neighbor-first caching strategy to enable efficient, platform-independent deployment of tasks at the extreme edge. Our simulations and real-world evaluations demonstrate that our approach facilitates the dynamic deployment and execution of tasks on resource-constrained devices while optimizing the network load within a mesh network configuration.
